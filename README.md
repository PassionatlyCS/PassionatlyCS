# Hi, I'm Syed Mohammad Usman Ali Bokhari  
## and I go by Usman Ali 👋

I'm an **AI Engineer** specializing in **Large Language Models, Agentic AI Systems, Deep Learning, and Large-Scale Data Engineering**. I build production-grade AI platforms, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, and high-performance machine learning pipelines used across enterprise environments.

I’ve delivered end-to-end ML systems in **logistics, retail, analytics, enterprise automation, and growth optimization**—from architecting multi-agent systems on **AWS Bedrock**, to developing routing engines that scale to **25,000+ trucks/minute**, to training LLMs using **advanced RL-based finetuning techniques**.

My expertise spans the full AI lifecycle:  
**LLM finetuning (PPO, DPO, GRPO), model alignment, scalable data workflows, Databricks optimization, FastAPI microservices, vector search, RAG systems, cloud orchestration, and distributed training.**

## 🔬 What I’m Working On
- 🌱 Exploring **reinforcement-learning–based LLM finetuning** (PPO, DPO, GRPO)  
- 🌱 Building **scalable training & inference pipelines** with FSDP and FlashAttention-2  
- 🌱 Designing **multi-agent orchestration frameworks** using Strands, AgentCore, and MCP  
- 🌱 Developing **enterprise-grade RAG and high-speed retrieval pipelines**
